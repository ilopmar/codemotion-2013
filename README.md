Codemotion 2013
===============

This is the demo project for my talk [Â¡Quiero tiempo real y lo quiero para ayer!](http://codemotion.es/talk/19-october/88) from Codemotion 2013.

The project repo has the following tags:

- fligth_1: Initial configuration. The emails are sent synchronously.
- fligth_2: Changing configuration the emails are sent asynchronously.
- fligth_3: Save additional stats without changing the code, only creating a new service.
- photo: Demo integrating with filesystem without pain and pushing pictures to browsers in real time.
- xmpp: Interact with an XMPP bot to check the weather and the stocks.
